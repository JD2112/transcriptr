# Integrative Genome Viewer
Thanks to **IGV-Shiny**, we have included a sub-section to visualize the BedGraph result in the genome viewer.

## Parameters and Genome View
1. Please select the *'bedgraph'* file from the drop-down list.
2. *'Run IGV'* and it will create the chromosome map on the side box, *'genome view'*.
3. In the *'Genome View'* box, select the chromosome number in interest.
4. Click on *'Add as BedGraph'* to view the result on the chromosome level.
5. Use cursor to zoom in/out on the location/region.
