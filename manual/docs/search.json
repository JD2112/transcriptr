At present, user can upload the DMC data produced by the main analysis (See Chapter 2). The input file should be in a text (tab-delimited) format.\n\n\n8.1.1.2 Parameters setup\n\nChoose pathway analysis type: Please select pathway analysis type from the drop-down list\n\nOver representation analysis (ORA);\nGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA); By default, the tool will use the over representation analysis.\n\nChoose pathway database: user can choose to use different pathway database, namely\n\nReactome,\nKEGG or\nWikipathways.\n\nChoose number of pathways: Please select number of pathways for graphical display. The default is Top 20 pathways. The Top 20 enriched pathways is selected based on the adjusted P-values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIf the analysis result does not get 20 pathways (as default setup) or the number selected by the user, then the plot will only shows the result with less number of pathways. User can change the parameters to see if they can get more number of enriched pathways.\nIf there is no enriched pathways with selected parameters, the figure tab may show warning like “check the logs or contact the author” , please change the parameters and run again the analysis. If you are experiencing trouble, donot hesitate to contact us.\n\n\n\n\nSelect P-value cut-off for correction: The default value for p-value correction is set to 0.05. User can set their own cut-off values.\nSelect P-value correction method: The default method for adjustment of P-value is the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction method. User can choose different method using the drop-down list:\n\nBenjamini-Hochberg (BH)\nBenjamini-Yeketuli (BY)\nBonferroni\nHolm\nHommel\nHochberg\nFDR\nnone\n\nUpload data file: The input file should be in a text (tab-delimited) format. The user can upload the ChAMP result file (DMC file) directly for the analysis."
