# TranscriptR: Transcriptome Data Analysis Pipeline

::: {.callout-caution}
PLEASE NOTE WE INCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF THE HUMAN TRANSCRIPTOME DATA ANALYSIS FROM THE SEQUENCE DATA. NONE OF THE OWNER OF THE CODE OR DATA CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING THE HUMAN DATA. IT IS UPTO THE USER IF THEY WANT TO USE THE ONLINE VERSION FOR HUMAN DATA ANALYSIS.

TranscriptR --introduction

After performing the sequencing, the major part is the analysis of the raw data generated from the machine. Numerous tools are available to analyze the data using different operating system, various computational languages. And all of these tools require extensive handling of computational resources. For the Biologist or those who have limited computational knowledge, it is extremely difficult to handle all these tools.

Here, in *TranscriptR*, we presented a shiny-based web server approach to minimize the above-mentioned difficulties. TranscriptR has graphical user interface to support and understand the various options used in the transcriptome data analysis with an extensive manual/tutorial how to use it. The background computational power depends on the user's computer (local use) which can also be optimized. We successfully tested the pipeline on Linux based system. \

## How to Use

### Local use
*TranscriptR* is packed into docker container that is available online. 
Please check the [github link](https://github.com/JD2112/transcriptr) to run the container from your local computer. \

::: {.callout-important}
Please remember, after start analyzing one transcriptome analysis run, the 'submit' button will be dectivated until refreshing the session. In this case, the user needs to upload the data again for another analysis.
