# Dimensional Analysis {#sec-multid}
^[TO ALL OUR USERS, IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING ANY TROUBLE WITH THE APP, BEFORE SENDING THE BUG REPORT, PLEASE RESTART THE DOCKER CONTAINER AND TRY AGAIN.]

In *TranscriptR*, multiple dimensional analysis includes two type of analysis - \
1. **MDS**: Multidimensional Scaling \
2. **PCA**: Prinicipal Component Analysis

Multidimensional scaling is a visual representation of distances or dissimilarities between set of objects. **MDS** finds set of vectors in *p*-dimensional space such that the matrix of Euclidean distance among them corresponds as closely as possible to some function of the input matrix. The input to multidimensional scaling is a distance matrix. To get some more details on how to use **MDS** in biological data, read [@mugavin2008multidimensional; @lacher1987interpretation; @lacher1988comparison] \
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the original vectors in n-dimensional space and the data are projected onto the directions in the data with the most variance.

## MDS
### How to use
For both analysis, user need to provide a **TEXT (tab-delimited) file with numeric values**, *e.g.* the output normalized (CPM) table from 'Transcriptome Analysis'. However the user can use similar tables for the analysis.

#### Data Upload
1. User can choose the option to use number of variables from the uploaded data file.
2. User can change the size of the points by using *'select size'*.
3. User can choose where to show which dimension (e.g. Select X/Y (axis) dimension - 1,2,3, etc.). Default is Dimension 1 for X-axis and Dimension 2 for Y-axis. 
4. Next, the user can change the label of X and Y-axis. 
5. Select the text file (tab-delimited file) and upload it.
6. In addition, we added the option to colour the groups. The user needs to upload the group file - one column file with different group names (same as number of samples).
7. To group the colour, the user needs to specify the number of groups. At present, maximum 10 groups can be coloured.

#### Analysis result
1. After the click on "Run MDS Analysis", the program will take some time to generate the plot and will appear as soon the run finishes. The zoom bar can be used to zoom in/out the plot.
2. The generated figure can be downloaded in different format, vector graphics support - PDF and SVG or PNG and TIFF. User can download all different options for the same figure. \

## PCA plot

### Data Upload
1. User can choose the option to use *number of most variables* (default is 1000) from the uploaded data file.
2. User can change the size of the points by using *'select size'* (default is 1).
3. User can write their own *Main title* for the plot (e.g., PCA plot).
4. User can write the *legend title* for the plot (e.g., Groups). 
5. Next, the user can change the label of X and Y-axis. 
6. User can choose to show the *'Mean point'*. The mean point calculates the mean value of the respective group and plot them.
7. User can *'Select Colour Palette'* from the drop-down list.
8. Select the text file (tab-delimited file) and upload it.
9. User needs to *'Upload group file'* (same as MDS) and *'Run PCA Analysis'*.

### Analysis Result
1. The generated plot is dynamic and positional details with the group name can be seen with mouse hovering.
2. The plot is generated using the plotly application, it can zoom in/out, save figure as PNG format, and do all other available functionality for plotly figures.
3. User can also download the dynamic figure as html file.

::: {.callout-note}
Please note that, the single column with header **"group"** should be supplied in this file. Match the column names of the variable data file with the group. \
***Example:***
If in the variable data file, the column names are -
    sampleA1 sampleA2 sampleA3  sampleB1    sampleB2    sampleB3
the group text file should be like this -
group \
A \
A \
A \
B \
B \
B \
